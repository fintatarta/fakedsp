This repository contains two small libraries (in C and Ada) that I wrote for my DSP course.  

The goal of this library is to allow the students to write software with the same "style" that they would use to write software running on a DSP, but working on a PC.  This started as a tool to be used to do debugging in a more forgiving environment (a PC) than a DSP running in real time.
