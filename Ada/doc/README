Searching for the html directory?  If you cannot see it, most probably
you just cloned the repository from the main page of github and
did not go to the release page where full archives are posted.

Well, you have two solutions
* Download the most recent release from the release page on github, or
* Create the documentation by yourself by running robodoc (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ROBODoc) in the directory above (Ada/, where the file robodoc.rc is)

Sorry for the inconvenience, but since the html documentation is an artifact
(in the sense that is created from the source files), it is not stored
in the repository
