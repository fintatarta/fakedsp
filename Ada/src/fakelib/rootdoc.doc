--****R* Root/Fakedsp
-- WHAT IS THIS?
--   This is the Ada version of the Fakedsp library. The library provides
--   the equivalent of a virtual card with an ADC and a DAC.  The ADC
--   acquires samples at a given sampling frequency and every time 
--   a sample is ready a 
--   |html <i>virtual interrupt handler</i> (written by the user) is called.   
--   At the same time the DAC updates its output.
--
--   The signal processing is typically carried out inside the virtual
--   interrupt handler.  The virtual handler can get the samples 
--   produced by the ADC by using the function Read_ADC and send the 
--   processed data to the DAC by using the procedure Write_DAC.
--
--   Of course, the ADC and DAC are not real; therefore, the ADC samples
--   will be read from a file and the DAC samples will be written to
--   a file.
--
-- HOW DO I USE IT?
--
--  The typical workflow is the following:
--  * Write the virtual interrupt handler (that, remember, will do the 
--    processing) by creating a 
--    |html <i>concrete version</i> of the interface Callback_Handler
--    defined in the package Fakedsp.Card.
--  * Create a Data_Source and a Data_Destination that will be used, 
--    respecitvely, from the ADC and the DAC for sample I/O.  The easiest
--    way to do this is to use the opening functions provided by 
--    the package Files
--  * Turn on the virtual card by calling the procedure Start in 
--    Fakedsp.Card  The code, behind the scenes,  will get the data
--    from the Data_Source, write Data to the Data_Destination and call
--    your handler
--
-- INSTALLING
--
--    The installation is very simple: just put the content of directory 
--    |html <code>fakelib/src</code> where your compiler will find it
--    and that's it!  If you use the Adacore project manager
--    |html <code>gprbuild</code>, just place the whole 
--    |html <code>Ada</code> directory somewhere and
--    |html <code>with</code> project 
--    |html <code>fakedsp.gpr</code> inside your 
--    |html <code>gpr</code> file.
--
-- EXAMPLE
--
--   You can find examples in the directory src/examples.  Currently there
--   is only one example, namely an example of processing with a notch filter.
--   Maybe more examples will be added in the future. This example can be
--   used as a starting point for your own processing code.
--
-- SEE ALSO
--
--   In the usual spirit of Ada, a detailed (enough) description of 
--   the interface of the different packages is embedded directly
--   in the spec file (extension
--   |html <code>.ads</ads>).  The most important
